+Some materials may have suitable optical properties but are unable to transport the photogenerated charge efficiently to the contact layers.

+At the macroscopic level Equation \ref{driftmobility} results from averaging over a large number of possible carrier trajectories. In the classical Drude model the carriers are free (the effect of the ion core potential is ignored), independant (the electron-electron Coloumb interaction is ignored) and they accelerate until colliding with a static ion core. For a carrier with charge $q$ and mass $m$ the mobility is given by\autocite{Kittel2005}

The most significant scattering mechanisms in a PV material are lattice scattering and ionized defect scattering. 
 A high dielectric constant is beneficial to carrier mobility as the rate of ionized defect scattering is proportional to $\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$. The composition of the material is also important -- for example, vacancies in gallium nitride (Ga$^{3+}$N$^{3-}$) carry a larger charge and have a larger scattering cross section than vacancies in MAPI (\ce{CH_3NH_3}$^{1+}$Pb$^{2+}$I$^{1+}_3$).

+To describe the interaction between the electron and phonon sub-systems it is assumed that the electrons respond instantaneously to the ionic motion.

 \begin{equation}
 g_{mnv}(\textbf{k},\textbf{q}) = -i\left(\frac{\hbar}{2N_pM_\kappa\nu_{\textbf{q}v}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\textbf{q}\cdot\textbf{e}_{kv}(\textbf{q})V_0,

+where $V_0$ is an average effective potential experienced by the electrons in the crystal, $M_\kappa$ is the mass of the $\kappa$th nucleus and $\textbf{e}_{kv}(\textbf{q})$ is a phonon eigenvector. The expression is independent of $k$ as a result of the approximations used in the derivation; the result is for a monovalent metal with one atom in the unit cell and where the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions can be approximated by free electrons.\autocite{Giustino2017,Wallis1963}%p.92
 
 The electron-phonon coupling term in Equation \ref{HamiltonianEP} contains a summation over all states in the electronic and vibrational Brillouin Zones. Considering all possible states is computationally intractable for many systems of interest, but the problem can be simplified by only considering the terms which make the most dominant contributions. In the case of covalent materials, it is assumed that the dominant interaction is between long wavelength acoustic phonon modes and electronic states. For ionic materials it is assumed that the dominant interaction is with the electric field generated by longitudinal optic phonons.

-When the polaron coupling is weak the kinetic energy is larger than the polaron binding energy, and the polaron radius is larger than a unit cell -- a large polaron is formed. When the polaron coupling is strong the electron is self-trapped, and the polaron radius is the size of a unit cell or smaller -- a small polaron is formed. The solution to Fr\"{o}lich model in Reference \cite{Frost2017b} gives Fr\"{o}lich coupling constants of $\alpha=2.4$ and $\alpha=2.7$ for the electron and hole in MAPI respectively. These values fall in the intermediate coupling regime where the large polaron model is valid. This corresponds to a polaron radii of $26.8\AA$ and $25.3\AA$ for the electron and hole respectively, at \SI{300}{\K}.

 Note that the calculated polaron radii are an upper bound, as bulk polaron states are further localised by disorder, point defects and extended defects such as surfaces, interfaces and grain boundaries.
 
-After polaron formation there is initial thermalisation, where electron kinetic energy is transferred into the optical phonon modes. This is a fast picosecond process via the strong Fr\"{o}lich coupling between the charge carrier and localised, polar phonon population. Once fully thermalised, the above bandgap energy is distributed amongst all phonon states associated with the polaron.
+In metals and other materials where the electron-phonon coupling is relatively homogeneous across the electron and phonon sub-systems, above-bandgap electrons cool over a single characteristic time scale.
+The excited electrons lose their energy through phonon emission and the electron and phonon sub-systems are assumed to remain in distinct thermal equilibria, each described by time-dependent temperatures $T_{\mathrm{el}}(t)$ and $T_{\mathrm{ph}}(t)$. This is the two-temperature model.\autocite{Kaganov1955}
+For materials where the electron-phonon coupling is heterogeneous, such as polar semiconductors with Fr\"{o}lich interactions, this model is not applicable, as the assumption that the phonon sub-system has reached a thermal equilibrium is not valid. 
+For these materials, the above-bandgap electrons will transfer kinetic energy into the phonon modes which couple strongly to the electron sub-system, and these ``hot'' phonon modes will thermalise to a temperature above that of the remaining bulk modes. A recent computational study across 12 cubic semiconductors found that in each system studied there are hot phonon modes which equilibriate with the electron sub-system rather than with the phonon sub-system.\autocite{Sadasivam2017} This is in contrast to the two-temperature model where all phonons are in thermal equilibrium.
+
+Transient spectroscopic studies\autocite{Klein2016,Price2015,Yang2016e} suggest that a hot photoexcited state persists in hybrid halide perovskites with a characteristic cooling time of up to \SI{100}{\pico\second}.
+We consider the hot photoexcited state to be a Fr\"{o}lich polaron which resonates with a subpopulation of local phonon states; after polaron formation there is initial thermalisation, electron kinetic energy is transferred into the optical phonon modes and a ``hot'' polaron is formed.
+This is a fast picosecond process via the strong Fr\"{o}lich coupling between the charge carrier and localised, polar phonon population. Once fully thermalised, the above bandgap energy is distributed amongst all phonon states associated with the polaron.
 
 %include IPR as proof for cage modes?
-The temperature of the resulting Fr\"{o}lich polaron depends on the polaron volume, the polaron specific heat capacity $C_v$ and the initial excitation energy (Figure \ref{ch5TemperatureRadius}). We assume that the polaron forms a sphere with a radius determined by the Fr\"{o}lich model (\SI{26.8}{\angstrom}) and that the initial excitation energy is distributed evenly between the electron and hole.

 The heat capacity is calculated from the bulk phonon calculation. Coupling to the optical cage modes ($\nu <$ \SI{5}{\tera\hertz}\autocite{Leguy2016}) at the gamma point are considered. The average temperature dependent energy $E(T)$ is determined by the phonon energies, $\epsilon_i = \hbar\nu_i$, and occupation numbers, as given by the Bose-Einstien distribution $n_i(T,\epsilon_i)$:
 \begin{equation}
     E(T) = \sum_i \epsilon_i n_i(T,\epsilon_i) = \sum_i \frac{\epsilon_i}{\textrm{e}^{\frac{\epsilon_i}{k_\mathrm{B}T}}-1}.

+This supercell expansion scales the magnitude of the lattice vectors in the $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions by a factor of $2\sqrt{2}$, $2\sqrt{2}$ and $2$ respectively. This expansion is more isotropic than a 192-atom supercell built from a diagonal transformation matrix, which would increase errors due to elastic effects. For example, $m_t=\mathrm{diag}(1,2,8)$ would increase the elastic error along the $x$ axis, as the local relaxation extends beyond a single unit cell.
 For the atomic relaxations a spin-polarised calculation with the PBEsol functional was used.\autocite{Perdew2008a} The internal atomic coordinates were relaxed until the force acting on each atom was less than \SI{0.01}{\electronvolt\per\angstrom}.

+\subsection{Calculation procedure for the optically excited states}
+
+The optically excited states of the $\mathrm{I}_2^-$ defect centres were calculated by Rachel Crespo Otero using the ``molecule in a crystal'' approach. The $\mathrm{I}_2^-$ molecule was embedded in a dielectric medium within the polarizable continuim model. Chloroform was considered as it has a dielectric constant of 4.8 which is close to the high-frequency dielectric constant of Iodine ($\epsilon^\infty=5.0$)\autocite{Leguy2016b}.
+To calculate the optical excitation energies linear-response time-dependent DFT was used as implemented in the Dalton2016 program.\autocite{Aidas2014} The PBE0 functional was used to describe exchange-correlation and relativistic effects were included using the spin-orbit coupling mean-field approach in combination with the Douglas-Kroll method.\autocite{Douglas1974}
+The all-electron basis set ANO-RCC, optimised for relativistic effects, was used for all atoms.
