P19. I guess a solar flux of 1361 Wm-2 is the average value? The Activity of Sun is not constant I suppose. 
P29. "3 - - 4"? May be "3-4"?

I also found alpha (in English, not in Greek) several times.
Page 51. Wasn't the LDA functional (correlation part) fitted to homogeneous electron gas? 
See http://cmt.dur.ac.uk/sjc/thesis_dlc/node29.html

Page 51. I didn't know that LDA generally underestimates the exchange but overestimate the correlation. I found this sentence "HEG-based LDAs have been known to typically underestimate the magnitude of the exchange energy E_x, while overestimating the magnitude of the correlation energy E_c" from this paper. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09740.pdf

Page 52. According to Kieron Burke, hybrid density functionals partially correct self-interaction error. https://dft.uci.edu/pubs/KSB14.pdf

Page 52. Please check equation 3.5. Correlation part is incomplete? 
BTW, I found some good presentations

Page 55. Figure 3.5. I think both states can be either bonding or anti-bonding. The criterion is whether there is a node between two atoms or not. Personally, I think in-phase and out-of-phase are a better description. 

Page 56. I would prefer to use "an initial guess" or "a simple guess" rather than "the initial guess" because that is not the only one approach. (For more detail check INIWAV tag)

Page 57. Was the classical potential defined previously? (See the caption)

Page 60. "If the growth conditions are rich for species i then mu_i will be low." Isn't it opposite?
