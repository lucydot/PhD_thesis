## Harmonic Parameters for Iodine interstitial defect in MAPI

### curvature

- neutral PES: 0.0047 eV
- negative PES: 0.0066 eV

### delta Q (between two minima)

- 46.17

### delta E (between two minima)

- 1.70eV

### Notes

- using supercell volume input in cm^3 - needs verficiation
- input files and output are included to extract parameters (volume, degeneracy) and EP coupling
- EP-coupling term is calculated at PBEsol level of theory
- Configuration Coordinate is at HSE06 level of theory
- The curvature of the PES is fairly independent of theory
- It would be great to have a sensitivity analysis of EP-coupling term and Delta E as I think that these carry the most uncertainty w.r.t. our calculations
