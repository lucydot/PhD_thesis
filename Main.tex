% I've (John) tried to comment this file extensively, so read through it to see how to use the various options.  Remember
% that in LaTeX, any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.

%%%%% LW - new command sections

\newcommand{\grun}{Gr\"{u}neisen }
\newcommand{\mob}{cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$}

%\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2212}{-}


%%%%% CHOOSE PAGE LAYOUT
% The most common choices should be below.  You can also do other things, like replacing "a4paper" with "letterpaper", etc.

% This one will format for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
%\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{ociamthesis}
% This one will format for one-sided binding (ie left margin > right margin; no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper]{ociamthesis}
% This one will format for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):
\documentclass[a4paper,nobind]{iclthesis} 

%%%%% LW - quotes
\usepackage{csquotes}

%%%%% LW - for pdf embeddding in appendix
\usepackage{pdfpages}

%%%%%LW - table options
\usepackage{dcolumn}% Align table columns on decimal point
\usepackage{booktabs}% introduce commands for toprule, cmidrule, bottomrule
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}   % increase spacing between rows

%%% For landscape table
\usepackage{pdflscape}
\usepackage{rotating}
\usepackage{afterpage}

%%%%% SELECT YOUR DRAFT OPTIONS
% Three options going on here; use in any combination.  But remember to turn the first two off before
% generating a PDF to send to the printer!

% This adds a "DRAFT" footer to every normal page.  (The first page of each chapter is not a "normal" page.)
\fancyfoot[C]{\emph{DRAFT Printed on \today}}  

% This highlights (in blue) corrections marked with (for words) \mccorrect{blah} or (for whole
% paragraphs) \begin{mccorrection} . . . \end{mccorrection}.  This can be useful for sending a PDF of
% your corrected thesis to your examiners for review.  Turn it off, and the blue disappears.
\correctionstrue


%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP
% Note that your bibliography will require some tweaking depending on your department, preferred format, etc.
% The options included below are just very basic "sciencey" and "humanitiesey" options to get started.
% If you've not used LaTeX before, I recommend reading a little about biblatex/biber and getting started with it.
% If you're already a LaTeX pro and are used to natbib or something, modify as necessary.
% Either way, you'll have to choose and configure an appropriate bibliography format...

% The science-type option: numerical in-text citation with references in order of appearance.
\usepackage[ style=nature, autocite=superscript, sorting=none, backend=bibtex, doi=false, eprint=false, isbn=false, url=false, doi=false, urldate=long]{biblatex}

% LW - all this so I can print date accessed a URL

}

% The humanities-type option: author-year in-text citation with an alphabetical works cited.
%\usepackage[style=authoryear, sorting=nyt, backend=biber, maxcitenames=2, useprefix, doi=false, isbn=false]{biblatex}
%\newcommand*{\bibtitle}{Works Cited}

% This makes the bibliography left-aligned (not 'justified') and slightly smaller font.
\renewcommand*{\bibfont}{\raggedright\small}


% Change this to the name of your .bib file (usually exported from a citation manager like Zotero or EndNote).
\addbibresource{references.bib}
\addbibresource{library.bib}


% Uncomment this if you want equation numbers per section (2.3.12), instead of per chapter (2.18):

%%%%% THESIS / TITLE PAGE INFORMATION
% Everybody needs to complete the following:
\title{Defects and Distortions in  \\  Hybrid Halide Perovskites}
\author{Lucy Dorothy Whalley}
\college{Department of Materials}

% Master's candidates who require the alternate title page (with candidate number and word count)
% must also un-comment and complete the following three lines:
%\masterssubmissiontrue
%\candidateno{933516}
%\wordcount{28,815}

% Uncomment the following line if your degree also includes exams (eg most masters):
%\renewcommand{\submittedtext}{Submitted in partial completion of the}
% Your full degree name.  (But remember that DPhils aren't "in" anything.  They're just DPhils.)
\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}
% Term and year of submission, or date if your board requires (eg most masters)
\degreedate{August 2019}


%%%%% YOUR OWN PERSONAL MACROS
% This is a good place to dump your own LaTeX macros as they come up.

% To make text superscripts shortcuts
	\renewcommand{\th}{\textsuperscript{th}} % ex: I won 4\th place
	\newcommand{\nd}{\textsuperscript{nd}}
	\renewcommand{\st}{\textsuperscript{st}}
	\newcommand{\rd}{\textsuperscript{rd}}

%%%%% THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT STARTS HERE
\begin{document}



%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR LINE SPACING HERE
% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{18pt plus2pt minus1pt}

% You can set the spacing here for the roman-numbered pages (acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.)
\setlength{\frontmatterbaselineskip}{17pt plus1pt minus1pt}

% Leave this line alone; it gets things started for the real document.
\setlength{\baselineskip}{\textbaselineskip}

%%%%% LW - paragraph options

\setlength{\parindent}{0cm}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.3\baselineskip}
%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but
% don't get numbers.)  Second, what level of section appears in the table of contents?  These don't have
% to match: you can have numbered sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that
% do.  Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 = paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}
% The level that shows up in the ToC:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}


%%%%% ABSTRACT SEPARATE
% This is used to create the separate, one-page abstract that you are required to hand into the Exam
% Schools.  You can comment it out to generate a PDF for printing or whatnot.
%\begin{abstractseparate}
%	\input{text/abstract} % Create an abstract.tex file in the 'text' folder for your abstract.
%\end{abstractseparate}


% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible until ToC.  This is in
% keeping with most typesetting conventions.
%\begin{romanpages}

% Title page is created here
\maketitle

%%%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{abstract}
	\input{text/abstract}
\end{abstract}

% This is where the whole-document ToC appears:
\tableofcontents

%%%%% DEDICATION -- If you'd like one, un-comment the following.
%\begin{dedication}
%This thesis is dedicated to\\
%someone\\
%for some special reason\\
%\end{dedication}

%%%%% COPYRIGHT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{copyright}
 	\input{text/copyright}
\end{copyright}

%%%%% DECLARATION -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{declaration}
 	\input{text/declaration}
\end{declaration}

%%%%% LW - publications
\begin{publications}
 	\input{text/publications}
\end{publications}

%%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{acknowledgements}
 	\input{text/acknowledgements}
\end{acknowledgements}



%%%%% MINI TABLES
% This lays the groundwork for per-chapter, mini tables of contents.  Comment the following line
% (and remove \minitoc from the chapter files) if you don't want this.  Un-comment either of the
% next two lines if you want a per-chapter list of figures or tables.
\dominitoc % include a mini table of contents
%\dominilof  % include a mini list of figures
%\dominilot  % include a mini list of tables

% This aligns the bottom of the text of each page.  It generally makes things look better.
\flushbottom



\listoffigures
	\mtcaddchapter
	
\listoftables
    \mtcaddchapter
% \mtcaddchapter is needed when adding a non-chapter (but chapter-like) entity to avoid confusing minitoc

% Uncomment to generate a list of tables:
%\listoftables
%	\mtcaddchapter

%%%%% LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS
% This example includes a list of abbreviations.  Look at text/abbreviations.tex to see how that file is
% formatted.  The template can handle any kind of list though, so this might be a good place for a
% glossary, etc.
\include{text/abbreviations}

%%%%% LIST OF symbols
\include{text/symbols}

% The Roman pages, like the Roman Empire, must come to its inevitable close.
%\end{romanpages}



%%%%% CHAPTERS
% Add or remove any chapters you'd like here, by file name (excluding '.tex'):
\flushbottom
%\include{text/ch1-intro}
%\include{text/ch2-litreview}
%\include{text/ch3-methods}
%\include{text/ch4-effmass}
%\include{text/ch5-epcoupling}
\include{text/ch6-defects}

%%% DEBUGGIN'
%\include{text/test}

%%%%%% LW - closing remarks
\begin{closing}
    \input{text/closing}
\end{closing}

%% APPENDICES %% 
% Starts lettered appendices, adds a heading in table of contents, and adds a
%    page that just says "Appendices" to signal the end of your main text.
\startappendices
% Add or remove any appendices you'd like here:
