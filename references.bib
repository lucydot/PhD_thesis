Today the AM 1.5G spectrum is the standard spectrum for non-concentrated photovoltaic conversion, taking light absorption and scattering in the atmosphere into account. New photovoltaic materials are investigated every day, but tabulated values to estimate their performance limits are difficult to find. Here values of the maximum short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), light to electric power conversion efficiency (η) as well as current density (Jmpp) and voltage (Vmpp) at the maximum power point are presented as a function of the light absorbers’ band gap energy."

abstract = "Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 is an attractive earth-abundant material for low-cost thin film photovoltaics with the capability to achieve power production in the terawatt range and therefore to supply a significant part of the global electricity needs. Despite its advantageous optical and electrical properties for photovoltaic applications, the large band tailing causes voltage losses that limit the efficiency of kesterite-based devices. Here we show that the band-tailing originates mainly from band-gap fluctuations attributable to chemical composition variations at nanoscale; while electrostatic fluctuations play a lesser role. Absorption measurement reveal that the Cu-Zn disorder, always present in kesterite Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4, is not the main source of the large band tailing. Instead defect clusters having a significant impact on the band-edge energies, e.g. [2CuZn−+SnZn2+], are proposed as the main origin for the kesterite band tail."

abstract  ="Bismuth-based solar absorbers are of interest due to similarities in the chemical properties of bismuth halides and the exceptionally efficient lead halide hybrid perovskites. Whilst they both experience the same beneficial relativistic effects acting to increase the width of the conduction band{,} bismuth is non-toxic and non-bioaccumulating{,} meaning the impact of environmental contamination is greatly reduced. Here{,} we use hybrid density functional theory{,} with the addition of spin orbit coupling{,} to examine two candidate bismuth containing photovoltaic absorbers{,} BiSI and BiSeI{,} and show that they possess electronic structures suitable for photovoltaic applications. Furthermore{,} we calculate band alignments against commonly used hole transporting and buffer layers{,} which indicate band misalignments are likely to be the source of the poor efficiencies reported for devices containing these materials. Based on this we have suggested alternative device architectures expected to result in improved power conversion efficiencies."}

abstract  ="Organic photovoltaics (OPV) offer a low-cost and esthetically appealing thin-film alternative to the well-known silicon-based solar panels{,} opening up new applications and markets. A substantial increase in power conversion efficiency (to over 13%) has been achieved for these organic solar cells over the last decade{,} largely as a result of intensive research on novel electron donor and acceptor materials{,} combined in a bulk heterojunction device structure. Nevertheless{,} it is clear that further progress is required to be competitive with more efficient traditional and other emerging thin-film PV technologies. At this moment{,} the device performance is (among others) limited by the low dielectric constants (εr = ∼3 to 4) of the state of the art photoactive organic materials. Important loss processes inherently connected to the strong coulombic interactions within low-permittivity organic materials can be suppressed through the enhancement of εr. High dielectric constant materials show lower exciton binding energies and hence recombination can be reduced{,} improving the charge carrier extraction efficiency. Despite these promising prospects{,} limited research has been devoted to the development and OPV integration of high-dielectric organic semiconductors. In here{,} an overview is provided of the approaches applied so far to enhance εr of organic compounds specifically developed for OPV purposes{,} commenting on the insights obtained and the challenges remaining."}

abstract  ="The efficiency of perovskite solar cells is approaching that of single-crystalline silicon solar cells despite the presence of a large grain boundary (GB) area in the polycrystalline thin films. Here{,} by using a combination of nanoscopic and macroscopic level measurements{,} we show that ion migration in polycrystalline perovskites dominates through GBs. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal much stronger hysteresis both for photocurrent and dark-current at the GBs than on the grain interiors{,} which can be explained by faster ion migration at the GBs. The dramatically enhanced ion migration results in the redistribution of ions along the GBs after electric poling{,} in contrast to the intact grain area. The perovskite single-crystal devices without GBs show negligible current hysteresis and no ion-migration signal. The discovery of dominating ion migration through GBs in perovskites can lead to broad applications in many types of devices including photovoltaics{,} memristors{,} and ion batteries."}

In a combined computational and experimental study{,} good agreement is obtained between experiment and the results of a charge transport model covering mixed ionic-electronic conduction. Our model couples electrons{,} holes and defect mediated ion motion suggesting that slow moving ions are indeed the origin of the hysteresis. The magnitude of the ion diffusion coefficient required to match experiment and theory{,} [similar]10-12 cm2 s-1{,} depends on the cell{,} but is similar to that predicted by microscopic theory of vacancy mediated diffusion.

We produce the perovskite films in a single step from a solution containing a mixture of FAI, PbI2, MABr, and PbBr2 (where FA stands for formamidinium cations and MA stands for methylammonium cations). Using mesoporous TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD as electron- and hole-specific contacts, respectively, we fabricate perovskite solar cells that achieve a maximum power-conversion efficiency of 20.8\% for a PbI2/FAI molar ratio of 1.05 in the precursor solution. Rietveld analysis of x-ray diffraction data reveals that the excess PbI2 content incorporated into such a film is about 3 weight percent. Time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements show that the small excess of PbI2 suppresses nonradiative charge carrier recombination. This in turn augments the external electroluminescence quantum efficiency to values of about 0.5\%, a record for perovskite photovoltaics approaching that of the best silicon solar cells. Correspondingly, the open-circuit photovoltage reaches 1.18 V under AM 1.5 sunlight.},

This is accompanied by an increase in sub-bandgap absorption at [similar]1.7 eV{,} indicating the formation of luminescent trap states. Light soaking causes a splitting of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks{,} suggesting segregation into two crystalline phases.

High-quality films are associated with slower PL decays, and it has been claimed that grain boundaries have a negligible impact on performance. We used confocal fluorescence microscopy correlated with scanning electron microscopy to spatially resolve the PL decay dynamics from films of nonstoichiometric organic-inorganic perovskites, CH3NH3PbI3(Cl). The PL intensities and lifetimes varied between different grains in the same film, even for films that exhibited long bulk lifetimes. The grain boundaries were dimmer and exhibited faster nonradiative decay. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy showed a positive correlation between chlorine concentration and regions of brighter PL, whereas PL imaging revealed that chemical treatment with pyridine could activate previously dark grains.},

abstract = {Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have demonstrated high power conversion efficiencies in solar cells and promising performance in a wide range of optoelectronic devices. The existence and stability of bound electron–hole pairs in these materials and their role in the operation of devices with different architectures remains a controversial issue. Here we demonstrate, through a combination of optical spectroscopy and multiscale modelling as a function of the degree of polycrystallinity and temperature, that the electron–hole interaction is sensitive to the microstructure of the material. The long-range order is disrupted by polycrystalline disorder and the variations in electrostatic potential found for smaller crystals suppress exciton formation, while larger crystals of the same composition demonstrate an unambiguous excitonic state. We conclude that fabrication procedures and morphology strongly influence perovskite behaviour, with both free carrier and excitonic regimes possible, with strong implications for optoelectronic devices.},

This tilt system gives the lowest energy structure because it maximizes the number of short {\it A}{---}O interactions. The rhombohedral {\it a}${\sp {$-$}}${\it a}${\sp {$-$}}${\it a}${\sp {$-$}}$ tilt system gives a structure with a slightly lower Madelung energy, but increased ion{--}ion repulsions destabilize this structure as the tilt angles increase. Consequently, it is stabilized by highly charged {\it A} cations and small to moderate tilt angles. The ideal cubic {\it a}${\sp 0}${\it a}${\sp 0}${\it a}${\sp 0}$ tilt system is only observed when stabilized by oversized {\it A} cations and/or {\it M}{---}O {$\pi$}-bonding. Tilt systems with nonequivalent {\it A}-site environments are observed when at least two {\it A} cations with different sizes and/or bonding preferences are present. In these compounds the ratio of large-to-small cations dictates the most stable tilt system.},

@article{Meloni2016,
abstract = {CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3) perovskites have attracted considerable attention as absorber materials for solar light harvesting, reaching solar to power conversion efficiencies above 20{\%}. In spite of the rapid evolution of the efficiencies, the understanding of basic properties of these semiconductors is still ongoing. One phenomenon with so far unclear origin is the so-called hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics of these solar cells. Here we investigate the origin of this phenomenon with a combined experimental and computational approach. Experimentally the activation energy for the hysteretic process is determined and compared with the computational results. First-principles simulations show that the timescale for MA(+) rotation excludes a MA-related ferroelectric effect as possible origin for the observed hysteresis. On the other hand, the computationally determined activation energies for halide ion (vacancy) migration are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined values, suggesting that the migration of this species causes the observed hysteretic behaviour of these solar cells.},

@article{Green2017,
abstract = {The past five years have seen significant cost reductions in photovoltaics and a correspondingly strong increase in uptake, with photovoltaics now positioned to provide one of the lowest-cost options for future electricity generation. What is becoming clear as the industry develops is that area-related costs, such as costs of encapsulation and field-installation, are increasingly important components of the total costs of photovoltaic electricity generation, with this trend expected to continue. Improved energy-conversion efficiency directly reduces such costs, with increased manufacturing volume likely to drive down the additional costs associated with implementing higher efficiencies. This suggests the industry will evolve beyond the standard single-junction solar cells that currently dominate commercial production, where energy-conversion efficiencies are fundamentally constrained by Shockley-Queisser limits to practical values below 30{\%}. This Review assesses the overall prospects for a range of approaches that can potentially exceed these limits, based on ultimate efficiency prospects, material requirements and developmental outlook.},

Dong et al. used a top-seeded solution growth method to obtain millimeter-scale single crystals of the organolead trihalide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. Under low light illumination, the electron and hole diffusion lengths exceeded 3 mm, and under full sunlight illumination, they exceeded 175 {\textmu}m.Science, this issue p. 967 Long, balanced electron and hole diffusion lengths greater than 100 nanometers in the polycrystalline organolead trihalide compound CH3NH3PbI3 are critical for highly efficient perovskite solar cells. We found that the diffusion lengths in CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals grown by a solution-growth method can exceed 175 micrometers under 1 sun (100 mW cm-2) illumination and exceed 3 millimeters under weak light for both electrons and holes. The internal quantum efficiencies approach 100\% in 3-millimeter-thick single-crystal perovskite solar cells under weak light. These long diffusion lengths result from greater carrier mobility, longer lifetime, and much smaller trap densities in the single crystals than in polycrystalline thin films. The long carrier diffusion lengths enabled the use of CH3NH3PbI3 in radiation sensing and energy harvesting through the gammavoltaic effect, with an efficiency of 3.9\% measured with an intense cesium-137 source.},

  abstract = {Emission characteristics of metal halide perovskites play a key role in the current widespread investigations into their potential uses in optoelectronics and photonics. However, a fundamental understanding of the molecular origin of the unusual blueshift of the bandgap and dual emission in perovskites is still lacking. In this direction, we investigated the extraordinary photoluminescence behavior of three representatives of this important class of photonic materials, that is, CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbBr3, and CH(NH2)2PbBr3, which emerged from our thorough studies of the effects of temperature on their bandgap and emission decay dynamics using time-integrated and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The low-temperature (\&lt;100 K) photoluminescence of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 reveals two distinct emission peaks, whereas that of CH(NH2)2PbBr3 shows a single emission peak. Furthermore, irrespective of perovskite composition, the bandgap exhibits an unusual blueshift by raising the temperature from 15 to 300 K. Density functional theory and classical molecular dynamics simulations allow for assigning the additional photoluminescence peak to the presence of molecularly disordered orthorhombic domains and also rationalize that the unusual blueshift of the bandgap with increasing temperature is due to the stabilization of the valence band maximum. Our findings provide new insights into the salient emission properties of perovskite materials, which define their performance in solar cells and light-emitting devices.},
