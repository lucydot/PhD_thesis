Today the AM 1.5G spectrum is the standard spectrum for non-concentrated photovoltaic conversion, taking light absorption and scattering in the atmosphere into account. New photovoltaic materials are investigated every day, but tabulated values to estimate their performance limits are difficult to find. Here values of the maximum short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), light to electric power conversion efficiency (η) as well as current density (Jmpp) and voltage (Vmpp) at the maximum power point are presented as a function of the light absorbers’ band gap energy."

abstract = "Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 is an attractive earth-abundant material for low-cost thin film photovoltaics with the capability to achieve power production in the terawatt range and therefore to supply a significant part of the global electricity needs. Despite its advantageous optical and electrical properties for photovoltaic applications, the large band tailing causes voltage losses that limit the efficiency of kesterite-based devices. Here we show that the band-tailing originates mainly from band-gap fluctuations attributable to chemical composition variations at nanoscale; while electrostatic fluctuations play a lesser role. Absorption measurement reveal that the Cu-Zn disorder, always present in kesterite Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4, is not the main source of the large band tailing. Instead defect clusters having a significant impact on the band-edge energies, e.g. [2CuZn−+SnZn2+], are proposed as the main origin for the kesterite band tail."

Whilst they both experience the same beneficial relativistic effects acting to increase the width of the conduction band{,} bismuth is non-toxic and non-bioaccumulating{,} meaning the impact of environmental contamination is greatly reduced. Here{,} we use hybrid density functional theory{,} with the addition of spin orbit coupling{,} to examine two candidate bismuth containing photovoltaic absorbers{,} BiSI and BiSeI{,} and show that they possess electronic structures suitable for photovoltaic applications. Furthermore{,} we calculate band alignments against commonly used hole transporting and buffer layers{,} which indicate band misalignments are likely to be the source of the poor efficiencies reported for devices containing these materials. Based on this we have suggested alternative device architectures expected to result in improved power conversion efficiencies."}

Nevertheless{,} it is clear that further progress is required to be competitive with more efficient traditional and other emerging thin-film PV technologies. At this moment{,} the device performance is (among others) limited by the low dielectric constants (εr = ∼3 to 4) of the state of the art photoactive organic materials. Important loss processes inherently connected to the strong coulombic interactions within low-permittivity organic materials can be suppressed through the enhancement of εr. High dielectric constant materials show lower exciton binding energies and hence recombination can be reduced{,} improving the charge carrier extraction efficiency. Despite these promising prospects{,} limited research has been devoted to the development and OPV integration of high-dielectric organic semiconductors. In here{,} an overview is provided of the approaches applied so far to enhance εr of organic compounds specifically developed for OPV purposes{,} commenting on the insights obtained and the challenges remaining."}

abstract  ="The efficiency of perovskite solar cells is approaching that of single-crystalline silicon solar cells despite the presence of a large grain boundary (GB) area in the polycrystalline thin films. Here{,} by using a combination of nanoscopic and macroscopic level measurements{,} we show that ion migration in polycrystalline perovskites dominates through GBs. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal much stronger hysteresis both for photocurrent and dark-current at the GBs than on the grain interiors{,} which can be explained by faster ion migration at the GBs. The dramatically enhanced ion migration results in the redistribution of ions along the GBs after electric poling{,} in contrast to the intact grain area. The perovskite single-crystal devices without GBs show negligible current hysteresis and no ion-migration signal. The discovery of dominating ion migration through GBs in perovskites can lead to broad applications in many types of devices including photovoltaics{,} memristors{,} and ion batteries."}

Our model couples electrons{,} holes and defect mediated ion motion suggesting that slow moving ions are indeed the origin of the hysteresis. The magnitude of the ion diffusion coefficient required to match experiment and theory{,} [similar]10-12 cm2 s-1{,} depends on the cell{,} but is similar to that predicted by microscopic theory of vacancy mediated diffusion.

We produce the perovskite films in a single step from a solution containing a mixture of FAI, PbI2, MABr, and PbBr2 (where FA stands for formamidinium cations and MA stands for methylammonium cations). Using mesoporous TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD as electron- and hole-specific contacts, respectively, we fabricate perovskite solar cells that achieve a maximum power-conversion efficiency of 20.8\% for a PbI2/FAI molar ratio of 1.05 in the precursor solution. Rietveld analysis of x-ray diffraction data reveals that the excess PbI2 content incorporated into such a film is about 3 weight percent. Time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements show that the small excess of PbI2 suppresses nonradiative charge carrier recombination. This in turn augments the external electroluminescence quantum efficiency to values of about 0.5\%, a record for perovskite photovoltaics approaching that of the best silicon solar cells. Correspondingly, the open-circuit photovoltage reaches 1.18 V under AM 1.5 sunlight.},

We used confocal fluorescence microscopy correlated with Scan.

abstract = {Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have demonstrated high power conversion efficiencies in solar cells and promising performance in a wide range of optoelectronic devices. The existence and stability of bound electron–hole pairs in these materials and their role in the operation of devices with different architectures remains a controversial issue. Here we demonstrate, through a combination of optical spectroscopy and multiscale modelling as a function of the degree of polycrystallinity and temperature, that the electron–hole interaction is sensitive to the microstructure of the material. The long-range order is disrupted by polycrystalline disorder and the variations in electrostatic potential found for smaller crystals suppress exciton formation, while larger crystals of the same composition demonstrate an unambiguous excitonic state. We conclude that fabrication procedures and morphology strongly influence perovskite behaviour, with both free carrier and excitonic regimes possible, with strong implications for optoelectronic devices.},

abstract = {The 23 Glazer tilt systems describing octahedral tilting in perovskites have been investigated. The various tilt systems have been compared in terms of their {\it A}-cation coordination and it is shown that those tilt systems in which all the {\it A}-cation sites remain crystallographically equivalent are strongly favored, when all the {\it A} sites are occupied by the same ion. Calculations based on both ionic and covalent models have been performed to compare the seven equivalent {\it A}-site tilt systems. Both methods predict that when the tilt angles become large, the orthorhombic {\it a}${\sp +}${\it b}${\sp {$-$}}${\it b}${\sp {$-$}}$ tilt system will result in the lowest energy structure. This tilt system gives the lowest energy structure because it maximizes the number of short {\it A}{---}O interactions. The rhombohedral {\it a}${\sp {$-$}}${\it a}${\sp {$-$}}${\it a}${\sp {$-$}}$ tilt system gives a structure with a slightly lower Madelung energy, but increased ion{--}ion repulsions destabilize this structure as the tilt angles increase. Consequently, it is stabilized by highly charged {\it A} cations and small to moderate tilt angles. The ideal cubic {\it a}${\sp 0}${\it a}${\sp 0}${\it a}${\sp 0}$ tilt system is only observed when stabilized by oversized {\it A} cations and/or {\it M}{---}O {$\pi$}-bonding. Tilt systems with nonequivalent {\it A}-site environments are observed when at least two {\it A} cations with different sizes and/or bonding preferences are present. In these compounds the ratio of large-to-small cations dictates the most stable tilt system.},

@article{Meloni2016,
abstract = {CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3) perovskites have attracted considerable attention as absorber materials for solar light harvesting, reaching solar to power conversion efficiencies above 20{\%}. In spite of the rapid evolution of the efficiencies, the understanding of basic properties of these semiconductors is still ongoing. One phenomenon with so far unclear origin is the so-called hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics of these solar cells. Here we investigate the origin of this phenomenon with a combined experimental and computational approach. Experimentally the activation energy for the hysteretic process is determined and compared with the computational results. First-principles simulations show that the timescale for MA(+) rotation excludes a MA-related ferroelectric effect as possible origin for the observed hysteresis. On the other hand, the computationally determined activation energies for halide ion (vacancy) migration are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined values, suggesting that the migration of this species causes the observed hysteretic behaviour of these solar cells.},

@article{Green2017,
abstract = {The past five years have seen significant cost reductions in photovoltaics and a correspondingly strong increase in uptake, with photovoltaics now positioned to provide one of the lowest-cost options for future electricity generation. What is becoming clear as the industry develops is that area-related costs, such as costs of encapsulation and field-installation, are increasingly important components of the total costs of photovoltaic electricity generation, with this trend expected to continue. Improved energy-conversion efficiency directly reduces such costs, with increased manufacturing volume likely to drive down the additional costs associated with implementing higher efficiencies. This suggests the industry will evolve beyond the standard single-junction solar cells that currently dominate commercial production, where energy-conversion efficiencies are fundamentally constrained by Shockley-Queisser limits to practical values below 30{\%}. This Review assesses the overall prospects for a range of approaches that can potentially exceed these limits, based on ultimate efficiency prospects, material requirements and developmental outlook.},

Dong et al. used a top-seeded solution growth method to obtain millimeter-scale single crystals of the organolead trihalide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. Under low light illumination, the electron and hole diffusion lengths exceeded 3 mm, and under full sunlight illumination, they exceeded 175 {\textmu}m.Science, this issue p. 967 Long, balanced electron and hole diffusion lengths greater than 100 nanometers in the polycrystalline organolead trihalide compound CH3NH3PbI3 are critical for highly efficient perovskite solar cells. We found that the diffusion lengths in CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals grown by a solution-growth method can exceed 175 micrometers under 1 sun (100 mW cm-2) illumination and exceed 3 millimeters under weak light for both electrons and holes. The internal quantum efficiencies approach 100\% in 3-millimeter-thick single-crystal perovskite solar cells under weak light. These long diffusion lengths result from greater carrier mobility, longer lifetime, and much smaller trap densities in the single crystals than in polycrystalline thin films. The long carrier diffusion lengths enabled the use of CH3NH3PbI3 in radiation sensing and energy harvesting through the gammavoltaic effect, with an efficiency of 3.9\% measured with an intense cesium-137 source.},

  abstract = {Emission characteristics of metal halide perovskites play a key role in the current widespread investigations into their potential uses in optoelectronics and photonics. However, a fundamental understanding of the molecular origin of the unusual blueshift of the bandgap and dual emission in perovskites is still lacking. In this direction, we investigated the extraordinary photoluminescence behavior of three representatives of this important class of photonic materials, that is, CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbBr3, and CH(NH2)2PbBr3, which emerged from our thorough studies of the effects of temperature on their bandgap and emission decay dynamics using time-integrated and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The low-temperature (\&lt;100 K) photoluminescence of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 reveals two distinct emission peaks, whereas that of CH(NH2)2PbBr3 shows a single emission peak. Furthermore, irrespective of perovskite composition, the bandgap exhibits an unusual blueshift by raising the temperature from 15 to 300 K. Density functional theory and classical molecular dynamics simulations allow for assigning the additional photoluminescence peak to the presence of molecularly disordered orthorhombic domains and also rationalize that the unusual blueshift of the bandgap with increasing temperature is due to the stabilization of the valence band maximum. Our findings provide new insights into the salient emission properties of perovskite materials, which define their performance in solar cells and light-emitting devices.},

	abstract = {The theoretical description of defects and impurities in semiconductors is largely based on density functional theory (DFT) employing supercell models. The literature discussion of uncertainties that limit the predictivity of this approach has focused mostly on two issues: (1) finite-size effects, in particular for charged defects; (2) the band-gap problem in local or semi-local DFT approximations. We here describe how finite-size effects (1) in the formation energy of charged defects can be accurately corrected in a simple way, i.e. by potential alignment in conjunction with a scaling of the Madelung-like screened first order correction term. The factor involved with this scaling depends only on the dielectric constant and the shape of the supercell, and quite accurately accounts for the full third order correction according to Makov and Payne. We further discuss in some detail the background and justification for this correction method, and also address the effect of the ionic screening on the magnitude of the image charge energy. In regard to (2) the band-gap problem, we discuss the merits of non-local external potentials that are added to the DFT Hamiltonian and allow for an empirical band-gap correction without significantly increasing the computational demand over that of standard DFT calculations. In combination with LDA + U, these potentials are further instrumental for the prediction of polaronic defects with localized holes in anion-p orbitals, such as the metal-site acceptors in wide-gap oxide semiconductors.}

	abstract = {The energy, the elastic dipole tensor and the entropy of point defects in ionic crystals are usually calculated by the Mott-Littleton approach, which treats a single defect in an infinite crystal. The authors suggest that there may be advantages, particularly for the dipole tensor and the entropy, in performing the calculations in periodically repeating geometry. They examine how this 'supercell' method can be used for the energy and the dipole tensor, paying attention to the problem that for charged defects the repeating unit carries a net charge, so that the Coulomb energy is divergent. They test the supercell method on a number of both charged and uncharged defects, and show that the results for the energy and dipole tensor are in close agreement with those obtained by the conventional approach.}

abstract = {The conductivity effective masses of electrons and holes in Si are calculated for carrier temperatures from 1 to 3000 K. The temperature dependence of the electron mass is calculated by use of a phenomenological model of conduction-band nonparabolicity that has been fitted to experimental measurements of the dependence of the electron conductivity effective mass on carrier concentration. The hole mass is investigated by tight-binding calculations of the valence bands, which have been adjusted to match experimental values of the valence-band curvature parameters at the top of the valence band. The calculations are in excellent agreement with femtosecond-laser reflectivity measurements of the change in optical effective mass as hot carriers cool from 1550 to 300 K.},

abstract={It is shown that the collective electron and London-Heitler models are not to be regarded as different approximations to the same exact wave function for solids in which, according to the former model, there is a partially filled zone of energy levels. It can thus be shown why nickel oxide in the pure state is a non-conductor, although it contains an incomplete zone. The properties of the metals nickel, palladium and platinum are discussed in the light of these results; platinum differs from nickel in that the orbital contribution to the moment of the elementary magnets is not quenched. A discussion is given of x-ray absorption edges, and it is shown why exciton lines are absent for metals.}

abstract = {Phonon scattering limits charge-carrier mobilities and governs emission line broadening in hybrid metal halide perovskites. Establishing how charge carriers interact with phonons in these materials is therefore essential for the development of high-efficiency perovskite photovoltaics and low-cost lasers. Here we investigate the temperature dependence of emission line broadening in the four commonly studied formamidinium and methylammonium perovskites, HC(NH2)2PbI3, HC(NH2)2PbBr3, CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3, and discover that scattering from longitudinal optical phonons via the Fr{\"{o}}hlich interaction is the dominant source of electron–phonon coupling near room temperature, with scattering off acoustic phonons negligible. We determine energies for the interacting longitudinal optical phonon modes to be 11.5 and 15.3 meV, and Fr{\"{o}}hlich coupling constants of {\~{}}40 and 60 meV for the lead iodide and bromide perovskites, respectively. Our findings correlate well with first-principles calculations based on many-body perturbation theory, which underlines the suitability of an electronic band-structure picture for describing charge carriers in hybrid perovskites.},

@article{Chen2015s,
abstract = {Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) based solar cells have shown impressive power conversion efficiencies of above 20{\%}. However, the microscopic mechanism of the high photovoltaic performance is yet to be fully understood. Particularly, the dynamics of CH3NH3+ cations and their impact on relevant processes such as charge recombination and exciton dissociation are still poorly understood. Here, using elastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering techniques and group theoretical analysis, we studied rotational modes of the CH3NH3+ cation in CH3NH3PbI3. Our results show that, in the cubic (T {\textgreater} 327 K) and tetragonal (165 K {\textless} T {\textless} 327 K) phases, the CH3NH3+ ions exhibit four-fold rotational symmetry of the C–N axis (C4) along with three-fold rotation around the C–N axis (C3), while in the orthorhombic phase (T {\textless} 165 K) only C3 rotation is present. At around room temperature, the characteristic relaxation times for the C4 rotation are found to be $\tau$C4 ≈ 5 ps while for the C3 rotation $\tau$C3 ≈ 1 ps. The T-dependent rotational relaxation times were fitted with Arrhenius equations to obtain activation energies. Our data show a close correlation between the C4 rotational mode and the temperature dependent dielectric permittivity. Our findings on the rotational dynamics of CH3NH3+ and the associated dipole have important implications for understanding the low exciton binding energy and a slow charge recombination rate in CH3NH3PbI3 which are directly relevant for the high solar cell performance.},

@article{Wang2015i,
abstract = {The carrier transport and optical properties of the hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 are investigated using first-principles approaches. We found that electron and hole mobilities could reach surprisingly high values of (7 {\~{}} 30) × 103 and (1.5 {\~{}} 5.5) × 103 cm2/V•s, respectively, and the both are estimated to be much higher than the current experimental measurement. The high mobility is ascribed to the intrinsically low effective masses of anti-bonding band-edge states. The above results imply that there is still space to improve the performance of the related solar cells. This material also has sharp photon absorption edge and absorption coefficient as high as 105 cm-1. Although band-edge states are mainly derived from the inorganic ions of Pb and I, the thermal movement of organic base has indirect influences on bandgap and effective masses of carriers by tuning the Pb-I interaction, leading to the temperature-dependence cell efficiency of photovoltaic devices.},

abstract  ="Metal-halide perovskites are outstanding materials for photovoltaics. Their long carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths favor efficient charge collection{,} leading to efficiencies competing with established photovoltaics. These observations suggest an apparently low density of traps in the prototype methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) contrary to the expected high defect density of a low-temperature{,} solution-processed material. Combining first-principles calculations and spectroscopic measurements we identify less abundant iodine defects as the source of photochemically active deep electron and hole traps in MAPbI3. The peculiar iodine redox chemistry leads{,} however{,} to kinetic deactivation of filled electron traps{,} leaving only short-living hole traps as potentially harmful defects. Under mild oxidizing conditions the amphoteric hole traps can be converted into kinetically inactive electron traps{,} providing a rationale for the defect tolerance of metal-halide perovskites. Bromine and chlorine doping of MAPbI3 also inactivate hole traps{,} possibly explaining the superior optoelectronic properties of mixed-halide perovskites."}

abstract = {Abstract By applying a multitude of experimental techniques including 1H, 14N, 207Pb NMR and 127I NMR/NQR, tracer diffusion, reaction cell and doping experiments, as well as stoichiometric variation, conductivity, and polarization experiments, iodine ions are unambiguously shown to be the mobile species in CH3NH3PbI3, with iodine vacancies shown to represent the mechanistic centers under equilibrium conditions. Pb2+ and CH3NH3+ ions do not significantly contribute to the long range transport (upper limits for their contributions are given), whereby the latter exhibit substantial local motion. The decisive electronic contribution to the mixed conductivity in the experimental window stems from electron holes. As holes can be associated with iodine orbitals, local variations of the iodine stoichiometry may be fast and enable light effects on ion transport.},

  abstract = {We address the behavior in which a bias voltage can be used to switch on and off the photoluminescence of a planar film of methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite (MAPbI(3)) semiconductor with lateral symmetric electrodes. It is observed that a dark region advances from the positive electrode at a slow velocity of order of 10 μm s(-1). Here we explain the existence of the sharp front by a drift of ionic vacancies limited by local saturation, that induce defects and drastically reduce the radiative recombination rate in the film. The model accounts for the time dependence of electrical current due to the ion-induced doping modification, that changes local electron and hole concentration with the drift of vacancies. The analysis of current dependence on time leads to a direct determination of the diffusion coefficient of iodine vacancies and provides detailed information of ionic effects over the electrooptical properties of hybrid perovskite materials.},
