I declare that this thesis and the work presented in it are my own and has been generated by me as the result of my own original research. I list below the instances where work has been done in conjunction with others.

\textbf{Chapter 2 - Theory and simulation of hybrid halide perovskites } 

The text in this chapter is largely reproduced from a published paper.\autocite{Whalley2017} The lead author is myself and co-authors are Jarvist M. Frost, Young-Kwang Jung and Aron Walsh.
The central idea of this paper (to review the theory and simulation of hybrid halide perovskites) was provided by Aron Walsh. Ideas for further contents of the review were a product of discussions between myself, Aron Walsh and Jarvist Frost. Figure 3 was prepared by Young-Kwang Jung. Figure 4 and Table 2 was prepared by Aron Walsh.

\textbf{Chapter 4  - Results I: The impact of electronic band non-parabolicity}

The text in this chapter is largely reproduced from a published paper.\autocite{Whalley2019} The lead author is myself and co-authors are Jarvist M. Frost, Benjamin J. Morgan and Aron Walsh. The central idea of this paper (to investigate, across a range of photovoltaic materials, the sensitivity of DFT calculated effective mass to fitting parameters) was provided by Aron Walsh and Benjamin Morgan. Jarvist Frost suggested weighting the fit to a Fermi-Dirac distribution.
