I declare that this thesis and the work presented in it are my own and has been generated by me as the result of my own original research. I list below the instances where work has been done in conjunction with others.

\textbf{Chapter 2 - Theory and simulation of hybrid halide perovskites } 

The text in this chapter is largely reproduced from a published paper.\autocite{Whalley2017} The co-authors are Jarvist M. Frost, Young-Kwang Jung and Aron Walsh.
The central idea of this paper (to review the theory and simulation of hybrid halide perovskites) was provided by Aron Walsh. Ideas for further contents of the review were a product of discussions between myself, Aron Walsh and Jarvist Frost. Figure 3 was prepared by Young-Kwang Jung. Figure 4 and Table 2 was prepared by Aron Walsh.
