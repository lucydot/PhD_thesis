  \caption[Charge transition diagram for higher energy iodine interstitial defects in MAPI]{Charge transition diagram for the higher energy iodine interstitial defects in MAPI. The defect geometries correspond to those in the solid boxes in Figure \ref{relaxation_workflow}. Defects with a lower energy were later found and the charge transition diagram for these are reported in the main text. For the defects reported here there are three charge transitions are in the bandgap, as found in the previous literature.\autocite{Du2015,Meggiolaro2018}}
