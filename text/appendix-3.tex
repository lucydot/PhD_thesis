\caption[Effective mass and $k$-point spacing]{The curvature effective mass (Equation \ref{}, in units of electron rest mass) calculated for different $k$-point spacings in reciprocal space for an electron in the [100] direction of CZTS. The finite difference fit and unweighted least-squares fit are calculated using three points. The weighted least squares fit is calculated using points up to $0.25\,\mathrm{eV}$ in energy. Details of each method are included in the Methods section of Chapter 4 in the main text. Calculations use the PBEsol exchange-correlation functional with spin-orbit coupling.}
