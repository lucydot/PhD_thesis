\chapter{\label{ch:6-defects}H-centre defects}

\section{Introduction}

Up until this chapter we have considered a lattice with perfect translational symmetry, and no missing or extra atoms. However at finite temperature a crystalline material always contains point defects, as the cost in lattice energy is balanced by the increase in configurational entropy.
In this chapter the iodine interstitial defect is predicted to form a split-interstitial defect with self-trapped hole ($\mathrm{I}_\mathrm{i}^-+\mathrm{I}_\mathrm{i}^-+\mathrm{h}^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{I}_\mathrm{2}^-$). The vibrational properties of the defect are studied to predict the coefficient for electron capture at this defect site.

As outlined briefly in Section \ref{recombination} we are often interested in semiconductor defects that form electronic states in the bandgap, as these can provide sites for non-radiative processes such as minority carrier trapping and electron-hole recombination, both of which limit the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cell absorber materials. Marshall Stoneham coined the term ``killer centre'' for defects with fast non-radiative transitions and lists the defect types that may act as performance killers. Two of four in the list relate to the vibrational properties of the defect lattice:

\begin{displayquote}
``2. Defects with favorable vibrational properties, that is, with large-amplitude modes promoting the transitions, and large-energy modes to take up the electronic energy.
3. Defects with very strong coupling to lattice distortions such as certain dislocations and some vacancy centers.''
\end{displayquote}

However historically there has been increased research emphasis on the electronic properties of ``killer defects'', as the calculations required to predict the vibrational properties of imperfect crystals from first principles are computationally demanding.
With recent advances in first principles modelling \cite{Alkauskas2014}%also sunghyun's paper an dalkauskas review 
and the growth in available computing power\cite{}
it is now possible to calculate from first principles the coupling strength between the electron and phonon sub-systems and predict the rate of carrier capture and recombination for systems of interest. 
This methodology has been recently applied to \ce{CZTS} where it has been found that the sulfur vacancy provides a site for fast non-radiative recombination.

Hybrid halide perovskite materials are classed in the literature as `defect tolerant' materials with low concentration of killer defects. This is for two reasons. 
Firstly, good photovoltaic efficiencies can be achieved using a low-temperature solution processing method which is expected to form a thin film with a high concentration of defects. 
he $V_\mathrm{oc}$ remains
%http://www.nature.com/articles/srep06071
Secondly, theoretical calculations show that Schottky and Frenkel point defects form at high concentrations, but that they form electronic states either in have shallow electronic states states ($< \mathrm{kT}$ from the bandgap) which are unlikely to contribute to non-radiative recombination.

% for this reason there is a flurry of interest
% point defects in HHPs published. They are a challenge: SoC and Hybrid are expensive. Low symmetry structure due to organic. inequivalent iodine sites. Soft lattice with large distortions: a challenge to model.
% neglect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in many previous DFT calculations resulted in incorrect positions of valence and conduction band edges, although their difference, which is the band gap, is in good agreement with the experimental value
% these will be most plentiful. 
% But increasingly DLTS and related techniques are being dismissed for halide perovskites as “misleading and produce wrong outcomes” because it is not only static defects that respond: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b00601
% David Cahen: Deep Level Transient Spectrocopy shows that there are shallow levels at 0.28eV, 0.17eV and a deep level at 0.7-0.8eV which has not been confirmed yet.
% Mitzi? Cahne? If we go to the Rose model of 1963 we see that there is a single recombination centre at 0.6-0.8eV, that this is the dominant recombination mechanism under steady state illumination, that recombination is trap mediated.

% iodine interstitial the mobile species - additional incentive to understand as linked to phase segregation and memory effects. There is a link between the ionic and he electronic - unusual as different time scales. To understand, need to understand the carrier capture processes.
% Some defects are introduced under illumination (and then passivated by oxygen): Photoinduced Emissive Trap States in Lead Halide Perovskite Semiconductors .
%In HHPs it is especially important to consider all forms of charge trapping as there is experimental evidence for the coupling between electronic and ionic states: this is linked to processes including hysteresis, ion migration, phase segregation.



% H-center defect castner and kanzig.
% V-centers have been studied in metal halide crystals since the1950s, including F2−impurities in CaF2and LiF, where F−anionsare normally present at specific lattice sites.5,6Related molecularhalide impurities have also been characterized in metal chlorides,bromides, and iodides.7They are unusual point defects as theyinvolvenomissing or extra atoms. A hole is introduced into apristine lattice, and the charge induces the formation of a bondbetween two nearest-neighbor halide ions, producing an open-shell dihalide species, 2X−+h+→X2−. In contrast to the V-center, the H-center is where hole-capture and dimer formationinvolves excess halide (for example, an interstitial) interactingwith a lattice site, X−+Xi−+h+→X2−. It has been shown that H-centers can be thermally converted into V-centers, and the twodefects have similar but distinguishable optical and electronicsignatures.5

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Defect formation energies}
% ionic relaxation:PREC= NORMA LREAL = AutoEDIFF = 1.0e-05EDIFFG = -0.01ENCUT = 550ISMEAR = 0SIGMA = 0.1ISPIN = 2 (spin-polarised)
% The interstitial is placed in a 192-atom supercell, which is built from the 2\sqrt2x2\sqrt2x2 expansion of the 12-atom cubic cell, using the transformation matrix [2 -2 0 // 2 2 0 // 0 0 2]
%Ionic relaxation at HSE06 confirms that there is very little distortion from PBEsol relaxed structure.
% Perfect structure confirmed stable from a phonon calculation.

% Using the HSE06 hybrid functional with spin-orbit coupling, and a 2x2x2 sampling of the electronic brillouin zone (gamma centred).PREC= NORMALREAL = AutoLCHARG = .TRUE.EDIFF = 1.0e-06ENCUT = 550SIGMA = 0.1. bandgap is correct with correct alpha.

% Using Daint. Importance of ROPT. Importance of alpha parameter

\subsection{Lattice dynamics}

\subsection{Carrier capture rates}

% @sunghyun will have to correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is that the waveunctions generated by vasp are not orthogonal so its not valid to calculate the overlap using the dot product. Pawpyseed can be used to orthogonalise the wavefunctions and then dot products can be done
% Yes, a WAVECAR file contains only the plane-wave coefficients for the smooth pseudo wave function and we also need the core part to do anything with the all-electron wave function.
% scaling factor not needed as neutral
% input the parameters (like degeneracy) from the input files

% Following the“molecule in crystal”approach7with dielectricembedding, we computed the optically excited states of the Cl2−,Br2−, and I2−defect centers as a function of bond lengths usingtime-dependent DFT (seeFigure 2) including relativistic effect
% However, certain point defects can act as color centers,with charge-conserving optically excited states. For example, thecolor (F) centers consisting of an electron trapped at a vacantlattice site in alkali halides, or self-trapped holes in heteropolarcrystals that are termed V-centers.

%essentially a multi-dimensional problem (where the dimensionality is 3N, N being the number of atoms in the system) is
%sufficient. The beauty of 1D cc diagrams is that often they are
%sufficient.51 As discussed in the Appendix, this is particularly the
%case for defects with strong electron–phonon coupling. In certain
%cases, the validity of this approximation can be demonstrated rigorously; we discuss one such example in the Appendix."

\textbf{Summary}
% Future work around the interaction between electronic and ionic states.
%  Themolecular iodide defects discussed here are not necessarily staticcarrier traps, because the halides that form the corner-sharingperovskite framework support reasonable rates of ion transport.Room-temperature diffusion is expected for the V-center, whichcould proceed in a pathway akin to vacancy-mediated diffusion.
% Transport of the H-center would require an interstitialcymechanism, which has also been predicted to be low energy inhalide perovskites.12The slow motion of trapped holes wouldadd a further layer to the complexity of the temporal response ofperovskite solar cells to light soaking and bias voltages (alsoevident in quantum dot photovoltaics13). Given the polyanionnature of iodine (e.g., charged I2up to I16complexes) and theflexibility of the perovskite structure, the formation of largercharged molecular aggregates is also possible for the iodideperovskites. Such polyanion inclusions in a crystal would beredox active and could facilitate additional electron or holetrapping, which is a fertile line of research for future studie
